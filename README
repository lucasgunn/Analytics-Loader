Load Analytics when YOU want

Does anyone else notice that when Analytics lags, it 
stops your scripts that are waiting for domready?

I've attempted to negate this by forcing analytics to 
load when I say, after my scripts have initialised.

So, hopefully, when Analytics does have one it's 
infamous lag times, my scripts have already kicked in
and the user is none the wiser.

Note: yes, this may result in some lost data, but 
personally, I'll take that over the user thinking 
my site is slow.
